# PCR Simulation

**Gene Info**
* E, envelope protein, protein_id="YP_009724392.1"
* Gene position: 26245:26472

**Goal**  
> The goal of this PCR project is to amplify and make many copies of the envelope protein (E gene) found in the COVID19 virus (SARS-CoV-2) through a complete process of denaturation, annealing, and extension. 

**What is PCR?**
> PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is a process used to amplify, or copy a gene many times to have a sufficient amount for a sequencing process. PCR is made up of three main steps, repeated a number of times: denaturation, annealing, and elongation.

**Methods**
* Complements  
* Primers
* Denaturation
* Annealing Elongation
* PCR Replication
* Statistics
